# ResumeBuilder
The Resume Builder is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create professional resumes easily. The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface where users can enter personal details, education, skills, projects, and experience.

Using JavaScript, the entered data is dynamically displayed in a structured resume format in real time. The design and layout are handled using HTML and CSS, ensuring responsiveness and a professional look.

The project also includes a download functionality, which enables users to directly download their resume as a file (PDF or printable format) to their local system. This allows users to save, share, or print their resumes instantly without any backend or database dependency.
